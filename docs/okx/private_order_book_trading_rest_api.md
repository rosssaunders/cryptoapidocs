# OKX API Documentation - Private Order Book Trading REST API

### Making Requests ###

All private REST requests must contain the following headers:

* `OK-ACCESS-KEY` The API Key as a String.

* `OK-ACCESS-SIGN` The Base64-encoded signature (see Signing Messages subsection for details).

* `OK-ACCESS-TIMESTAMP` The UTC timestamp of your request .e.g : 2020-12-08T09:08:57.715Z

* `OK-ACCESS-PASSPHRASE` The passphrase you specified when creating the APIKey.

Request bodies should have content type `application/json` and be in valid JSON format.

### Signature ###

The `OK-ACCESS-SIGN` header is generated as follows:

* Create a prehash string of timestamp + method + requestPath + body (where + represents String concatenation).
* Prepare the SecretKey.
* Sign the prehash string with the SecretKey using the HMAC SHA256.
* Encode the signature in the Base64 format.

Example: `sign=CryptoJS.enc.Base64.stringify(CryptoJS.HmacSHA256(timestamp + 'GET' + '/api/v5/account/balance?ccy=BTC', SecretKey))`

The `timestamp` value is the same as the `OK-ACCESS-TIMESTAMP` header with millisecond ISO format, e.g. `2020-12-08T09:08:57.715Z`.

The request method should be in UPPERCASE: e.g. `GET` and `POST`.

The `requestPath` is the path of requesting an endpoint.

Example: `/api/v5/account/balance`

The `body` refers to the String of the request body. It can be omitted if there is no request body (frequently the case for `GET` requests).

Example: `{"instId":"BTC-USDT","lever":"5","mgnMode":"isolated"}`

`GET` request parameters are counted as requestpath, not body

The SecretKey is generated when you create an APIKey.

Example: `22582BD0CFF14C41EDBF1AB98506286D`

General Info
----------

**The rules for placing orders at the exchange level are as follows:**

* The maximum number of pending orders (including post only orders, limit orders and taker orders that are being processed): 4,000
* The maximum number of pending orders per trading symbol is 500, the limit of 500 pending orders applies to the following **order types**:

  * Limit
  * Market
  * Post only
  * Fill or Kill (FOK)
  * Immediate or Cancel (IOC)
  * Market order with Immediate-or-Cancel order (optimal limit IOC)
  * Take Profit / Stop Loss (TP/SL)
  * Limit and market orders triggered under the order types below:
    * Take Profit / Stop Loss (TP/SL)
    * Trigger
    * Trailing stop
    * Arbitrage
    * Iceberg
    * TWAP
    * Recurring buy

* The maximum number of pending spread orders: 500 across all spreads

* The maximum number of pending algo orders:

  * TP/SL order: 100 per instrument
  * Trigger order: 500
  * Trailing order: 50
  * Iceberg order: 100
  * TWAP order: 20

* The maximum number of grid trading

  * Spot grid: 100
  * Contract grid: 100

**The rules for trading are as follows:**

* When the number of maker orders matched with a taker order exceeds the maximum number limit of 1000, the taker order will be canceled.
  * The limit orders will only be executed with a portion corresponding to 1000 maker orders and the remainder will be canceled.
  * Fill or Kill (FOK) orders will be canceled directly.

**The rules for the returning data are as follows:**

* `code` and `msg` represent the request result or error reason when the return data has `code`, and has not `sCode`;

* It is `sCode` and `sMsg` that represent the request result or error reason when the return data has `sCode` rather than `code` and `msg`.

**The introduction of `instFamily`:**

* There are no difference between `uly` and `instFamily`:
  * For BTC-USD-SWAP, `uly` and `instFamily` are both BTC-USD. For BTC-USDC-SWAP, `uly` and `instFamily` are both BTC-USDC.
  * If you set the request parameter "uly" as BTC-USD, you will get the data for BTC-USD (coin-margined) contracts.
  * If you set the request parameter "instFamily" as BTC-USD, then you also will get data for BTC-USD (coin-margined) contracts.  

* You can look up the corresponding instFamily of each instrument from the "Get instruments" endpoint.

---

Transaction Timeouts
----------

Orders may not be processed in time due to network delay or busy OKX servers. You can configure the expiry time of the request using `expTime` if you want the order request to be discarded after a specific time.

If `expTime` is specified in the requests for Place (multiple) orders or Amend (multiple) orders, the request will not be processed if the current system time of the server is after the `expTime`.

---

### REST API ###

Rate Limits
----------

Our REST and WebSocket APIs use rate limits to protect our APIs against malicious usage so our trading platform can operate reliably and fairly.  
When a request is rejected by our system due to rate limits, the system returns error code 50011 (Rate limit reached. Please refer to API documentation and throttle requests accordingly).  
The rate limit is different for each endpoint. You can find the limit for each endpoint from the endpoint details. Rate limit definitions are detailed below:

* WebSocket login and subscription rate limits are based on connection.

* Public unauthenticated REST rate limits are based on IP address.

* Private REST rate limits are based on User ID (sub-accounts have individual User IDs).

* WebSocket order management rate limits are based on User ID (sub-accounts have individual User IDs).

For Trading-related APIs (place order, cancel order, and amend order) the following conditions apply:

* Rate limits are shared across the REST and WebSocket channels.

* Rate limits for placing orders, amending orders, and cancelling orders are independent from each other.

* Rate limits are defined on the Instrument ID level (except Options)

* Rate limits for Options are defined based on the Instrument Family level. Refer to the [Get instruments](/docs-v5/en/#public-data-rest-api-get-instruments) endpoint to view Instrument Family information.

* Rate limits for a multiple order endpoint and a single order endpoint are also independent, with the exception being when there is only one order sent to a multiple order endpoint, the order will be counted as a single order and adopt the single order rate limit.

---

### Sub-account rate limit ###

At the sub-account level, we allow a maximum of 1000 order requests per 2 seconds. Only new order requests and amendment order requests will be counted towards this limit. The limit encompasses all requests from the endpoints below. For batch order requests consisting of multiple orders, each order will be counted individually. Error code 50061 is returned when the sub-account rate limit is exceeded. The existing rate limit rule per instrument ID remains unchanged and the existing rate limit and sub-account rate limit will operate in parallel. If clients require a higher rate limit, clients can trade via multiple sub-accounts.

* [POST / Place order](/docs-v5/en/#order-book-trading-trade-post-place-order)
* [POST / Place multiple orders](/docs-v5/en/#order-book-trading-trade-post-place-multiple-orders)
* [POST / Amend order](/docs-v5/en/#order-book-trading-trade-post-amend-order)
* [POST / Amend multiple orders](/docs-v5/en/#order-book-trading-trade-post-amend-multiple-orders)

* [WS / Place order](/docs-v5/en/#order-book-trading-trade-ws-place-order)

* [WS / Place multiple orders](/docs-v5/en/#order-book-trading-trade-ws-place-multiple-orders)

* [WS / Amend order](/docs-v5/en/#order-book-trading-trade-ws-amend-order)

* [WS / Amend multiple orders](/docs-v5/en/#order-book-trading-trade-ws-amend-multiple-orders)

### Fill ratio based sub-account rate limit ###

This is only applicable to \>= VIP5 customers.  
As an incentive for more efficient trading, the exchange will offer a higher sub-account rate limit to clients with a high trade fill ratio.   

The exchange calculates two ratios based on the transaction data from the past 7 days at 00:00 UTC.

1. Sub-account fill ratio: This ratio is determined by dividing (the trade volume in USDT of the sub-account) by (sum of (new and amendment request count per symbol \* symbol multiplier) of the sub-account). Note that the master trading account itself is also considered as a sub-account in this context.
2. Master account aggregated fill ratio: This ratio is calculated by dividing (the trade volume in USDT on the master account level) by (the sum (new and amendment count per symbol \* symbol multiplier] of all sub-accounts).

The symbol multiplier allows for fine-tuning the weight of each symbol. A smaller symbol multiplier (\<1) is used for smaller pairs that require more updates per trading volume. All instruments have a default symbol multiplier, and some instruments will have overridden symbol multipliers.

|    InstType     |    Override rule    |                                       Overridden symbol multiplier                                        |Default symbol multiplier|
|-----------------|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------|
|Perpetual Futures|  Per instrument ID  |`1`   <br/>Instrument ID:   <br/>BTC-USDT-SWAP   <br/>BTC-USD-SWAP   <br/>ETH-USDT-SWAP   <br/>ETH-USD-SWAP|          `0.2`          |
| Expiry Futures  |Per instrument Family|       `0.3`   <br/>Instrument Family:   <br/>BTC-USDT   <br/>BTC-USD   <br/>ETH-USDT   <br/>ETH-USD       |          `0.1`          |
|      Spot       |  Per instrument ID  |                        `0.5`   <br/>Instrument ID:   <br/>BTC-USDT   <br/>ETH-USDT                        |          `0.1`          |
|     Options     |Per instrument Family|                                                                                                           |          `0.1`          |

The fill ratio computation excludes block trading, spread trading, MMP and fiat orders for order count; and excludes block trading, spread trading for trade volume. Only successful order requests (sCode=0) are considered.

At 08:00 UTC, the system will use the maximum value between the sub-account fill ratio and the master account aggregated fill ratio based on the data snapshot at 00:00 UTC to determine the sub-account rate limit based on the table below. For broker (non-disclosed) clients, the system considers the sub-account fill ratio only.

|      |Fill ratio[x\<=ratio\<y)|Sub-account rate limit per 2 seconds(new and amendment)|
|------|------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
|Tier 1|         [0,1)          |                         1,000                         |
|Tier 2|         [1,2)          |                         1,250                         |
|Tier 3|         [2,3)          |                         1,500                         |
|Tier 4|         [3,5)          |                         1,750                         |
|Tier 5|         [5,10)         |                         2,000                         |
|Tier 6|        [10,20)         |                         2,500                         |
|Tier 7|        [20,50)         |                         3,000                         |
|Tier 8|         \>= 50         |                        10,000                         |

If there is an improvement in the fill ratio and rate limit to be uplifted, the uplift will take effect immediately at 08:00 UTC. However, if the fill ratio decreases and the rate limit needs to be lowered, a one-day grace period will be granted, and the lowered rate limit will only be implemented on T+1 at 08:00 UTC. On T+1, if the fill ratio improves, the higher rate limit will be applied accordingly. In the event of client demotion to VIP4, their rate limit will be downgraded to Tier 1, accompanied by a one-day grace period.

If the 7-day trading volume of a sub-account is less than 1,000,000 USDT, the fill ratio of the master account will be applied to it.

For newly created sub-accounts, the Tier 1 rate limit will be applied at creation until T+1 8am UTC, at which the normal rules will be applied.

Block trading, spread trading, MMP and spot/margin orders are exempted from the sub-account rate limit.

The exchange offers [GET / Account rate limit](/docs-v5/en/#order-book-trading-trade-get-account-rate-limit) endpoint that provides ratio and rate limit data, which will be updated daily at 8am UTC. It will return the sub-account fill ratio, the master account aggregated fill ratio, current sub-account rate limit and sub-account rate limit on T+1 (applicable if the rate limit is going to be demoted).  

The fill ratio and rate limit calculation example is shown below. Client has 3 accounts, symbol multiplier for BTC-USDT-SWAP = 1 and XRP-USDT = 0.1.

1. Account A (master account):
   1. BTC-USDT-SWAP trade volume = 100 USDT, order count = 10;
   2. XRP-USDT trade volume = 20 USDT, order count = 15;
   3. Sub-account ratio = (100+20) / (10 \* 1 + 15 \* 0.1) = 10.4

2. Account B (sub-account):
   1. BTC-USDT-SWAP trade volume = 200 USDT, order count = 100;
   2. XRP-USDT trade volume = 20 USDT, order count = 30;
   3. Sub-account ratio = (200+20) / (100 \* 1 + 30 \* 0.1) = 2.13

3. Account C (sub-account):
   1. BTC-USDT-SWAP trade volume = 300 USDT, order count = 1000;
   2. XRP-USDT trade volume = 20 USDT, order count = 45;
   3. Sub-account ratio = (300+20) / (100 \* 1 + 45 \* 0.1) = 3.06

4. Master account aggregated fill ratio = (100+20+200+20+300+20) / (10 \* 1 + 15 \* 0.1 + 100 \* 1 + 30 \* 0.1 + 100 \* 1 + 45 \* 0.1) = 3.01
5. Rate limit of accounts
   1. Account A = max(10.4, 3.01) = 10.4 -\> 2500 order requests/2s
   2. Account B = max(2.13, 3.01) = 3.01 -\> 1750 order requests/2s
   3. Account C = max(3.06, 3.01) = 3.06 -\> 1750 order requests/2s

### Best practices ###

If you require a higher request rate than our rate limit, you can set up different sub-accounts to batch request rate limits. We recommend this method for throttling or spacing out requests in order to maximize each accounts' rate limit and avoid disconnections or rejections.

listTime and auctionEndTime  
For spot symbols listed through a call auction, listTime represents the start time of the auction, and auctionEndTime indicates the end of the auction and the start of continuous trading. For other scenarios, listTime will mark the beginning of continuous trading, and auctionEndTime will return an empty value "". state  
The state will always change from `preopen` to `live` when the listTime is reached.  
When a product is going to be delisted (e.g. when a FUTURES contract is settled or OPTION contract is exercised), the instrument will not be available.

instId  
If the instrument ever had position and its open interest is 0, it will return the position information with specific instId. It will not return the position information with specific instId if there is no valid posId; it will not return the position information without specific instId. In the isolated margin trading settings, if it is set to the manual transfers mode, after the position is transferred to the margin, a position with a position of 0 will be generated

### Set position mode ###

Spot and futures mode and Multi-currency mode: `FUTURES` and `SWAP` support both `long/short` mode and `net` mode. In `net` mode, users can only have positions in one direction; In `long/short` mode, users can hold positions in long and short directions.  
Portfolio margin mode: `FUTURES` and `SWAP` only support `net` mode

### Set leverage ###

There are 10 different scenarios for leverage setting:   

1. Set leverage for `MARGIN` instruments under `isolated-margin` trade mode at pairs level.   
2. Set leverage for `MARGIN` instruments under `cross-margin` trade mode and Spot mode (enabled borrow) at currency level.   
3. Set leverage for `MARGIN` instruments under `cross-margin` trade mode and Spot and futures mode account mode at pairs level.   
4. Set leverage for `MARGIN` instruments under `cross-margin` trade mode and Multi-currency margin at currency level.   
5. Set leverage for `MARGIN` instruments under `cross-margin` trade mode and Portfolio margin at currency level.   
6. Set leverage for `FUTURES` instruments under `cross-margin` trade mode at underlying level.   
7. Set leverage for `FUTURES` instruments under `isolated-margin` trade mode and buy/sell position mode at contract level.   
8. Set leverage for `FUTURES` instruments under `isolated-margin` trade mode and long/short position mode at contract and position side level.   
9. Set leverage for `SWAP` instruments under `cross-margin` trade at contract level.   
10. Set leverage for `SWAP` instruments under `isolated-margin` trade mode and buy/sell position mode at contract level.   
11. Set leverage for `SWAP` instruments under `isolated-margin` trade mode and long/short position mode at contract and position side level.   

Note that the request parameter `posSide` is only required when margin mode is isolated in long/short position mode for FUTURES/SWAP instruments (see scenario 8 and 11 above).   
Please refer to the request examples on the right for each case.

### Preset account mode switch ###

Pre-set the required information for account mode switching. When switching from `Portfolio margin mode` back to `Spot and futures mode` / `Multi-currency margin mode`, and if there are existing cross-margin contract positions, it is mandatory to pre-set leverage.

If the user does not follow the required settings, they will receive an error message during the pre-check or when setting the account mode.

#### Response parameters ####

|--------------|--------|---------------------------------------------------|
|  curAcctLv   | String |               Current account mode                |
|    acctLv    | String |             Account mode after switch             |
|    lever     | String |The leverage user preset for cross-margin positions|
|riskOffsetType| String | ~~The risk offset type user preset~~(Deprecated)  |

lever: When switching from Portfolio margin mode to Spot and futures mode or Multi-currency margin mode, if the user holds cross-margin positions, this parameter must be provided; otherwise, error code 50014 will occur. The maximum allowable value for this parameter is determined by the smallest maximum leverage based on current position sizes under the target mode. For example, if a user in PM mode holds three cross-margin positions, with maximum allowable leverage of 20x, 50x, and 100x respectively, the maximum leverage it can set is 20x.

### Set account mode ###

You need to set on the Web/App for the first set of every account mode. If users plan to switch account modes while holding positions, they should first call the preset endpoint to conduct necessary settings, then call the precheck endpoint to get unmatched information, margin check, and other related information, and finally call the account mode switch endpoint to switch account modes.

### Set MMP ###

This endpoint is used to set MMP configure  

Only applicable to Option in Portfolio Margin mode, and MMP privilege is required.

What is MMP?  
Market Maker Protection (MMP) is an automated mechanism for market makers to pull their quotes when their executions exceed a certain threshold(`qtyLimit`) within a certain time frame(`timeInterval`). Once mmp is triggered, any pre-existing mmp pending orders(`mmp` and `mmp\_and\_post\_only` orders) will be automatically canceled, and new orders tagged as MMP will be rejected for a specific duration(`frozenInterval`), or until manual reset by makers.  

How to enable MMP?  
Please send an email to institutional@okx.com or contact your business development (BD) manager to apply for MMP. The initial threshold will be upon your request.

tdMode  
Trade Mode, when placing an order, you need to specify the trade mode.  
**Spot mode:**  
\- SPOT and OPTION buyer: cash  
**Spot and futures mode:**  
\- Isolated MARGIN: isolated  
\- Cross MARGIN: cross  
\- SPOT: cash  
\- Cross FUTURES/SWAP/OPTION: cross  
\- Isolated FUTURES/SWAP/OPTION: isolated  
**Multi-currency margin mode:**  
\- Isolated MARGIN: isolated  
\- Cross SPOT: cross  
\- Cross FUTURES/SWAP/OPTION: cross  
\- Isolated FUTURES/SWAP/OPTION: isolated  
**Portfolio margin:**  
\- Isolated MARGIN: isolated  
\- Cross SPOT: cross  
\- Cross FUTURES/SWAP/OPTION: cross  
\- Isolated FUTURES/SWAP/OPTION: isolated clOrdId  
clOrdId is a user-defined unique ID used to identify the order. It will be included in the response parameters if you have specified during order submission, and can be used as a request parameter to the endpoints to query, cancel and amend orders.   
clOrdId must be unique among the clOrdIds of all pending orders. posSide  
Position side, this parameter is not mandatory in **net** mode. If you pass it through, the only valid value is **net**.  
In **long/short** mode, it is mandatory. Valid values are **long** or **short**.  
In **long/short** mode, **side** and **posSide** need to be specified in the combinations below:  
Open long: buy and open long (side: fill in buy; posSide: fill in long)  
Open short: sell and open short (side: fill in sell; posSide: fill in short)  
Close long: sell and close long (side: fill in sell; posSide: fill in long)  
Close short: buy and close short (side: fill in buy; posSide: fill in short)  
Portfolio margin mode: Expiry Futures and Perpetual Futures only support net mode ordType   
Order type. When creating a new order, you must specify the order type. The order type you specify will affect: 1) what order parameters are required, and 2) how the matching system executes your order. The following are valid order types:   
limit: Limit order, which requires specified sz and px.   
market: Market order. For SPOT and MARGIN, market order will be filled with market price (by swiping opposite order book). For Expiry Futures and Perpetual Futures, market order will be placed to order book with most aggressive price allowed by Price Limit Mechanism. For OPTION, market order is not supported yet. As the filled price for market orders cannot be determined in advance, OKX reserves/freezes your quote currency by an additional 5% for risk check.   
post\_only: Post-only order, which the order can only provide liquidity to the market and be a maker. If the order would have executed on placement, it will be canceled instead.   
fok: Fill or kill order. If the order cannot be fully filled, the order will be canceled. The order would not be partially filled.   
ioc: Immediate or cancel order. Immediately execute the transaction at the order price, cancel the remaining unfilled quantity of the order, and the order quantity will not be displayed in the order book.   
optimal\_limit\_ioc: Market order with ioc (immediate or cancel). Immediately execute the transaction of this market order, cancel the remaining unfilled quantity of the order, and the order quantity will not be displayed in the order book. Only applicable to Expiry Futures and Perpetual Futures. sz  
Quantity to buy or sell.   
For SPOT/MARGIN Buy and Sell Limit Orders, it refers to the quantity in base currency.   
For MARGIN Buy Market Orders, it refers to the quantity in quote currency.   
For MARGIN Sell Market Orders, it refers to the quantity in base currency.   
For SPOT Market Orders, it is set by tgtCcy.   
For FUTURES/SWAP/OPTION orders, it refers to the number of contracts. reduceOnly  
When placing an order with this parameter set to true, it means that the order will reduce the size of the position only  
For the same MARGIN instrument, the coin quantity of all reverse direction pending orders adds `sz` of new `reduceOnly` order cannot exceed the position assets. After the debt is paid off, if there is a remaining size of orders, the position will not be opened in reverse, but will be traded in SPOT.  
For the same FUTURES/SWAP instrument, the sum of the current order size and all reverse direction reduce-only pending orders which’s price-time priority is higher than the current order, cannot exceed the contract quantity of position.  
Only applicable to `Spot and futures mode` and `Multi-currency margin`  
Only applicable to `MARGIN` orders, and `FUTURES`/`SWAP` orders in `net` mode  
Notice: Under long/short mode of Expiry Futures and Perpetual Futures, all closing orders apply the reduce-only feature which is not affected by this parameter. tgtCcy  
This parameter is used to specify the order quantity in the order request is denominated in the quantity of base or quote currency. This is applicable to SPOT Market Orders only.  
Base currency: base\_ccy  
Quote currency: quote\_ccy  
If you use the Base Currency quantity for buy market orders or the Quote Currency for sell market orders, please note:  
1. If the quantity you enter is greater than what you can buy or sell, the system will execute the order according to your maximum buyable or sellable quantity. If you want to trade according to the specified quantity, you should use Limit orders.  
2. When the market price is too volatile, the locked balance may not be sufficient to buy the Base Currency quantity or sell to receive the Quote Currency that you specified. We will change the quantity of the order to execute the order based on best effort principle based on your account balance. In addition, we will try to over lock a fraction of your balance to avoid changing the order quantity.  
2.1 Example of base currency buy market order:  
Taking the market order to buy 10 LTCs as an example, and the user can buy 11 LTC. At this time, if 10 \< 11, the order is accepted. When the LTC-USDT market price is 200, and the locked balance of the user is 3,000 USDT, as 200\*10 \< 3,000, the market order of 10 LTC is fully executed;
If the market is too volatile and the LTC-USDT market price becomes 400, 400\*10 \> 3,000, the user's locked balance is not sufficient to buy using the specified amount of base currency, the user's maximum locked balance of 3,000 USDT will be used to settle the trade. Final transaction quantity becomes 3,000/400 = 7.5 LTC.  
2.2 Example of quote currency sell market order:  
Taking the market order to sell 1,000 USDT as an example, and the user can sell 1,200 USDT, 1,000 \< 1,200, the order is accepted. When the LTC-USDT market price is 200, and the locked balance of the user is 6 LTC, as 1,000/200 \< 6, the market order of 1,000 USDT is fully executed;
If the market is too volatile and the LTC-USDT market price becomes 100, 100\*6 \< 1,000, the user's locked balance is not sufficient to sell using the specified amount of quote currency, the user's maximum locked balance of 6 LTC will be used to settle the trade. Final transaction quantity becomes 6 \* 100 = 600 USDT. px  
The value for px must be a multiple of tickSz for OPTION orders.  
If not, the system will apply the rounding rules below. Using tickSz 0.0005 as an example:  
The px will be rounded up to the nearest 0.0005 when the remainder of px to 0.0005 is more than 0.00025 or `px` is less than 0.0005.  
The px will be rounded down to the nearest 0.0005 when the remainder of px to 0.0005 is less than 0.00025 and `px` is more than 0.0005. For placing order with TP/Sl:  
1. TP/SL algo order will be generated only when this order is filled fully, or there is no TP/SL algo order generated.  
2. Attaching TP/SL is neither supported for market buy with tgtCcy is base\_ccy or market sell with tgtCcy is quote\_ccy  
3. If tpOrdKind is limit, and there is only one conditional TP order, attachAlgoClOrdId can be used as clOrdId for retrieving on "GET / Order details" endpoint.  
4. For “split TPs”, including condition TP order and limit TP order.  
\* TP/SL orders in Split TPs only support one-way TP/SL. You can't use slTriggerPx&slOrdPx and tpTriggerPx&tpOrdPx at the same time, or error code 51076 will be thrown.  
\* Take-profit trigger price types (tpTriggerPxType) must be the same in an order with Split TPs attached, or error code 51080 will be thrown.  
\* Take-profit trigger prices (tpTriggerPx) cannot be the same in an order with Split TPs attached, or error code 51081 will be thrown.  
\* The size of the TP order among split TPs attached cannot be empty, or error code 51089 will be thrown.  
\* The total size of TP orders with Split TPs attached in a same order should equal the size of this order, or error code 51083 will be thrown.  
\* The number of TP orders with Split TPs attached in a same order cannot exceed 10, or error code 51079 will be thrown.  
\* Setting multiple TP and cost-price SL orders isn’t supported for spot and margin trading, or error code 51077 will be thrown.  
\* The number of SL orders with Split TPs attached in a same order cannot exceed 1, or error code 51084 will be thrown.  
\* The number of TP orders cannot be less than 2 when cost-price SL is enabled (amendPxOnTriggerType set as 1) for Split TPs, or error code 51085 will be thrown.  
\* All TP orders in one order must be of the same type, or error code 51091 will be thrown.  
\* TP order prices (tpOrdPx) in one order must be different, or error code 51092 will be thrown.  
\* TP limit order prices (tpOrdPx) in one order can't be –1 (market price), or error code 51093 will be thrown.  
\* You can't place TP limit orders in spot, margin, or options trading. Otherwise, error code 51094 will be thrown.  
Mandatory self trade prevention (STP)  
The trading platform imposes mandatory self trade prevention at master account level, which means the accounts under the same master account, including master account itself and all its affiliated sub-accounts, will be prevented from self trade. The default STP mode is `Cancel Maker`. Users can also utilize the stpMode request parameter of the placing order endpoint to determine the stpMode of a certain order.  
Mandatory self trade prevention will not lead to latency.   
There are three STP modes. The STP mode is always taken based on the configuration in the taker order.  
1. Cancel Maker: This is the default STP mode, which cancels the maker order to prevent self-trading. Then, the taker order continues to match with the next order based on the order book priority.  
2. Cancel Taker: The taker order is canceled to prevent self-trading. If the user's own maker order is lower in the order book priority, the taker order is partially filled and then canceled. FOK orders are always honored and canceled if they would result in self-trading.  
3. Cancel Both: Both taker and maker orders are canceled to prevent self-trading. If the user's own maker order is lower in the order book priority, the taker order is partially filled. Then, the remaining quantity of the taker order and the first maker order are canceled. FOK orders are not supported in this mode.

### POST / Place multiple orders ###

Place orders in batches. Maximum 20 orders can be placed per request.   
Request parameters should be passed in the form of an array. Orders will be placed in turn  

#### Rate Limit: 300 orders per 2 seconds ####

#### Rate Limit of lead instruments for Copy Trading: 4 orders per 2 seconds ####

#### Rate limit rule (except Options): User ID + Instrument ID ####

#### Rate limit rule (Options only): User ID + Instrument Family ####

#### Permission: Trade ####

Rate limit of this endpoint will also be affected by the rules [Sub-account rate limit](/docs-v5/en/#overview-rate-limits-sub-account-rate-limit) and [Fill ratio based sub-account rate limit](/docs-v5/en/#overview-rate-limits-fill-ratio-based-sub-account-rate-limit).

Unlike other endpoints, the rate limit of this endpoint is determined by the number of orders. If there is only one order in the request, it will consume the rate limit of `Place order`.

Cancel order returns with sCode equal to 0. It is not strictly considered that the order has been canceled. It only means that your cancellation request has been accepted by the system server. The result of the cancellation is subject to the state pushed by the order channel or the get order state.

newSz   
If the new quantity of the order is less than or equal to the filled quantity when you are amending a partially-filled order, the order status will be changed to filled. The amend order returns sCode equal to 0. It is not strictly considered that the order has been amended. It only means that your amend order request has been accepted by the system server. The result of the amend is subject to the status pushed by the order channel or the order status query

---

### POST / Amend multiple orders ###

Amend incomplete orders in batches. Maximum 20 orders can be amended per request. Request parameters should be passed in the form of an array.

#### Rate Limit: 300 orders per 2 seconds ####

#### Rate Limit of lead instruments for Copy Trading: 4 orders per 2 seconds ####

#### Rate limit rule (except Options): User ID + Instrument ID ####

#### Rate limit rule (Options only): User ID + Instrument Family ####

#### Permission: Trade ####

Rate limit of this endpoint will also be affected by the rules [Sub-account rate limit](/docs-v5/en/#overview-rate-limits-sub-account-rate-limit) and [Fill ratio based sub-account rate limit](/docs-v5/en/#overview-rate-limits-fill-ratio-based-sub-account-rate-limit).

Unlike other endpoints, the rate limit of this endpoint is determined by the number of orders. If there is only one order in the request, it will consume the rate limit of `Amend order`.

|triggerTime|String|The time the cancellation is triggered.  <br/>triggerTime=0 means Cancel All After is disabled.|
|    tag    |String|                                         CAA order tag                                         |

Users are recommended to send heartbeat to the exchange every second. When the cancel all after is triggered, the trading engine will cancel orders on behalf of the client one by one and this operation may take up to a few seconds. This feature is intended as a protection mechanism for clients only and clients should not use this feature as part of their trading strategies.   
To use tag level CAA, first, users need to set tags for their orders using the `tag` request parameter in the placing orders endpoint. When calling the CAA endpoint, if the `tag` request parameter is not provided, the default will be to set CAA at the account level. In this case, all pending orders for all order book trading symbols under that sub-account will be cancelled when CAA triggers, consistent with the existing logic. If the `tag` request parameter is provided, CAA will be set at the order tag level. When triggered, only pending orders of order book trading symbols with the specified tag will be canceled, while orders with other tags or no tags will remain unaffected.  

Users can run a maximum of 20 tag level CAAs simultaneously under the same sub-account. The system will only count live tag level CAAs. CAAs that have been triggered or revoked by the user will not be counted. The user will receive error code 51071 when exceeding the limit.

During call auction, users can get the updates of equilibrium price, matched size, unmatched size, and auction end time. The data will be updated around once a second. The endpoint returns the actual open price, matched size, and unmatched size when the call auction ends.  
For symbols that never go through call auction, the endpoint will also return results but with state always as `continuous\_trading` and other fields as 0 or empty.
